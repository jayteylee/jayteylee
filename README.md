👋 Hey there! My name is Jay Lee and I am currently a third year student studying at the University of Otago Majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Software Engineering.

📖 I’m currently learning Computational Problem Solving, Database Theory and Applications and Software Project Management.

👨‍💼 I have experience in end-to-end development from a previous internship and am looking for graduate roles in 2024!
